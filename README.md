# 📖 A new kind of Library in your hands
"I wish people could discover my stories"

Lumen & Leaf present itself as an application avaible on a desktop or a smartphone. This project revolves around my experience as an apprentice developer whose outcome is the completion of a personal project to develop a Participatory Virtual Library Online.

"Lumen&Leaf" bridges the gap between authors and readers by delivering a platform where unknow writes can post their creation under the form of card and reader can drop a book to add to his collection in a fancy way with the "Randomizer" function.

That is a whole system, a Node.js backend application that implements a content management platform with dual-database architecture. The system provides REST APIs for managing books, categories, collections, genres, and user authentication, with file upload capabilities and JWT-based security.

# 🚀 Purpose
Over the years, the rate of young people who can quote you the title of more than 10 different books apart from those they are required to read during their schooling is in free fall. Both in France and around the world, the population abandons small authors and focuses only on best-sellers written by authors surrounded by the biggest publishing houses. They often read or reread the same works. To quote the international, when one asks a third person "what is your favorite novel?" , answers usually turn to Harry Potter or Hunger Games. Fewer and fewer readers seek to neither diversify nor stand out. In France, on the shelves of our bookstores, books by famous authors who died several centuries ago, such as Victor Hugo, Marcel Proust or Molière fill the entire shelves. The current large authors occupy the entire same corridor. There is no place left for the new independent author, who nevertheless knows how to be bursting with talent, to introduce his pen to an outside audience. And it’s exactly the same system online on sites such as Amazon.fr or Fnac.com. I have personally always had a certain admiration for literature and especially authors all as they are. Conveying emotions through the sole force of words so that they can echo our imagination requires playing with them. And this, the little authors do it wonderfully.

Nothing makes me happier than talking about a book that touched me with a friend. Except that generally, he knows neither the book nor the author because he simply has never heard of it. 

The problem we are facing is the loss of taste for reading and interest in small authors. Currently, it is difficult to be able to promote one’s projects without any budget or notoriety, which hinders the good development of an author. 
My platform will allow users to build their own online library and thus contribute to a collective base. Mine adds the fact of being able to add randomly referenced books published by an author by clicking on an add button to their personal collection, in order not to create favouritism among authors. And in the way of watching a trailer before being sure and certain to buy one’s ticket in order to see it entirely in the cinema or test the demo before the complete purchase of a video game, the users will have the opportunity to read a premise of the author’s work by clicking on his card. He will also be able to click on the author’s link to see the personal biography that he himself will have written. Thus the author has a much better chance of reaching his audience, and users to discover works they were unaware of by pushing them to click on a button to unlock all the author’s works.
